### What I find interesting
I think that this article highlights the core aspects of what defines a software engineer
and what they are expected to do on a daily basis in terms of a job perspective. The article
mentions a lot of skills that are honed both in and out of university, including programming languages,
platforms, architecture, and such. I think that this culmination of knowledge both in and out
of our academic lives helps highlight how much holistic knowledge (both theoretical and applied) we
as software engineers must have to be successful. Beyond just learning about data structures, algorithms,
architecture, and operating systems, we as software engineers must learn to apply these skills
in a practical manner - thus we do things such as internships and open source projects. That is one
of the reasons why computer science as a field is so appealing to many people - because it goes
beyond being merely theoretical and becomes applied, even at a university level. Being able to
work on interesting projects at the company level helps bring longevity to interest in the field.
